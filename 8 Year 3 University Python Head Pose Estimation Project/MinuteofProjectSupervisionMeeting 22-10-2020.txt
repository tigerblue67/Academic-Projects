Worked on problem description. 
Researched into the project with current solutions and available research articles. 
Planned the development of the system.

Decisions:
Problem description needs a greater focus on automotive side of things
Problem description needs a greater focus on the software engineering side
Problem description needs more detail to be ~ 4 pages
Pose recognition will be written from scratch although facial recognition does not need to be written from scratch due to the complexity 
Until the system has its full functionality we will be working with ideal conditions cropped faces with good lighting etc. once functionality has been established we can move onto dealing with other conditions.
