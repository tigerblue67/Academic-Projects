# Academic-Projects

This Project is a collection of some of my Academic Projects at Secondary School and at University and are listed in Chronological order:


1: Completed in 2016-17 while studying computing in secondary school is a Windows form application written in C# designed to be an application for a car rental service to use to manage bookings to their business via a bespoke user interface, there is a very detailed report within this for further information.


2: Completed in 2017-18 during my first year of university, this was a piece of coursework for my 'Programming' module written in Java to have the ability for a business to monitor the availability of products from a range of suppliers.


3: Completed in 2017-18 during my first year of university, this is a project assignment that was completed as a part of my 'Databases' module, the objective of this project was to create a MySQL database and make changes to a provided Java program to be used as a business HR and Payroll Management system.


4: Completed in 2017-18 during my first year of university, this was a group project assingment that I completed alongside 3 other students with the objective to create a website geared towards a fashion blog written in HTML/JavaScript with a Java webserver backend.


5: Completed in 2020 during my third year of university, this project was completed as part of my 'Cloud Computing' module with the objective to create a cloud based, calculator with a web interface, to take full advantage of cloud technologies, every function of the calculator; plus, minus, multiply, divide etc all written in different programming languages in different docker containers, the different functions and features are written in the following languages with the associated docker image:

  Main interface of the calculator is written in HTML/JavaScript
  
  Add function is written in PHP
  
  Subtract function is written in Java
  
  Multiply function is written in Python
  
  Divide function is written in Golang
  
  Square function is written in Ruby on Rails
  
  X*10^y function is written in Golang but was run in Google Functions FAAS
  
All of these functions communicated via HTTP requests, in this project there was also a challenge to create added functionality to the calculator by adding the following:

  Monitoring and metrics application written in Golang with a HTTP interface
  
  Reverse proxy application written in Golang for the frontend to communicate with each function 
  
  Saving the results of calculation with the ability to load previous results based off an id
  
  
6: Completed in 2020 during my third year of university, this was a group project with 2 other students to create an application that can detect faces from images with testing using a number of different machine learning techniques from K nearest neighbors, SVM, Random forest and more, this application was written and run in MATLAB.



7: Work in progress, This is my final year project written in Python, the hoal of this project is to be able to effectively detect a persons head position with a focus on an automotive application to allow auto manufacturers to issue warnings to driver if it has been detected that the driver is distracted or possibly using their mobile phone or has fallen asleep by detecting the drivers head position and determining if this can be considered a significant risk.
